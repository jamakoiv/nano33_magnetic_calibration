Calculate gain and offset values for translating raw magnetometer values to unit sphere.

The raw sensor values are read from Arduino Nano 33 BLE board with LSM9DS1 IMU.
The code running on the board can be found from repository [https://github.com/jamakoiv/Nano33Ahrs2Joystick](https://github.com/jamakoiv/Nano33Ahrs2Joystick).

Originally the aim of the project was to learn embedding matplotlib-plots in QT-applications,
and generally learn QT-framework.
